Final part of my Web Development Project

JavaScript Features Implemented

A comprehensive lightbox gallery was implemented to enhance the user experience when viewing product images. The system includes:

Dynamic Lightbox Creation: The lightbox HTML structure is created programmatically when the page loads, ensuring it's available across all pages without manual HTML additions

Image Click Events: All product images (from product groups, cards, and feature items) are made clickable with visual cursor feedback

Full-Screen Viewing: Clicking any product image opens a full-screen lightbox view with a semi-transparent dark overlay

Smooth Animations: Images scale up with smooth transitions and subtle shadow effects for a premium feel

Multiple Close Methods:

Click the 'X' button in the top-right corner

Click anywhere outside the image

Press the Escape key

Accessibility Features: Prevents background scrolling when lightbox is active and restores it when closed

2. Form Validation & Processing
Enhanced form functionality was implemented across all contact and enquiry forms:

Real-time Email Validation: Uses regular expressions to validate email format as users type, with visual feedback (red borders for invalid, green for valid)

Enquiry Form Processing: The enquiry form dynamically processes user inputs and generates instant quote responses based on service selection

Formspree Integration: Contact forms are configured to work with Formspree's email service for reliable form submission handling

User Feedback System: Clear visual responses and success messages after form submission

3. Search and Filter Functionality
A dynamic search system was implemented for product and service filtering:

Real-time Filtering: As users type in the search input, items are filtered instantly without page reload

Multiple Data Sources: The search function checks multiple potential data sources including data attributes, text content, and nested elements

Flexible Matching: Uses case-insensitive partial matching to find relevant results

Visual Feedback: Non-matching items are hidden while matching items remain visible

4. Cart Functionality Enhancements
The shopping cart was enhanced with dynamic functionality:

Quantity Update Handling: Event listeners monitor quantity changes in cart items

Future-Proof Architecture: Placeholder functions for cart total calculations and price updates
